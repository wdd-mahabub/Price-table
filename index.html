                  Companies House and HMRC.<br><br>
                  <b>How are my letters handled?</b><br>
                  Each time we receive a letter addressed to you, we’ll forward it and deduct one credit from your
                  account. One letter = one credit.<br><br>
                  <b>How does the credit system work?</b><br>
                  When purchasing this service, you’ll be asked to add additional credits to your account. You can
                  choose from 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 credits. The number of credits you choose, is the number of business
                  letters we’ll forward. For example, if you buy 10 credits, we will forward up to 10 letters to you.
                  <br><br>
                  <b>How much do credits cost?</b> <br>
                  To see credit prices, simply visit our registration page, select the Business Address Service, and
                  you’ll see the available credit options along with their pricing.<br><br>
                  <b>Will a credit be used for junk mail?</b><br>
                  No — we do not deduct credits for obvious junk mail. We do our best to filter out and discard unwanted
                  or clearly non-business-related items before sending your letters.<br><br>
                  <b>What happens when I run out of credits?</b><br>
                  You’ll receive an email notification when your credits are low or used up. To continue receiving
                  forwarded letters, simply log in and top up your credits at any time.<br><br>
                  <b>Can I carry unused credits into the next year?</b><br>
                  Unused credits are valid for 12 months from the date of purchase. After one year, any unused credits
                  will expire.

                  This service includes free forwarding of all official letters from Companies House and HMRC—with no
                  charge to you.<br><br>
                  In addition, you also receive 50 free credits to forward your business letters. Business letters
                  include mail from your bank, clients, and other third parties. To clarify, any letter that is not from
                  Companies House or HMRC is recognised as a business letter.<br><br>
                  <b>What if I use up all 50 credits?</b><br>
                  It’s uncommon to exceed 50 business letters per year—most companies receive around 10. However, if you
                  do need more, you can easily purchase additional credits anytime through your dashboard.
